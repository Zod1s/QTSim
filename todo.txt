Feedback quantum cooling
|- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04270 (it should have reasonable models to test our framework (it may be infinite-dimensional (how to simulate???)))

|> It seems like adding a delay between subsequent activations of the feedback may help convergence, needs to study why and which are sensible values for this delay

|> Understand what reduced efficiency implies
