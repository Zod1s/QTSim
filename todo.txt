Feedback quantum cooling
|- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04270 (it should have reasonable models to test our framework (it may be infinite-dimensional (how to simulate??? Not only, but our feedback only works for now in the finite-dimensional setting)))
|- https://journals.aps.org/pra/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevA.60.2700 (gives some models, but they are infinite-dimensional, compares filtering-based and wiseman-milburn)

|> Code improvements
|- Decouple simulation and control time, simulating at a higher rate to simulate a discrete-time controller, whereas as of now we are simulating an istantaneous feedback
|- Add a function to generate a random density matrix by generating a random X and then computing \rho = X^\dag X / Tr[X^\dag X]
|- Add efficiency support, test its impact

|> Using L = I - \rho_d as the measurement operator leads Tr[L\rho] to be V(\rho) = 1 - Tr[\rho\rho_d], the same function as Mirrahimi and Van Handel, so it is clear that, since we are measuring it, we can employ its structure. Clearly we are enforcing the fact that we are in the cooling setting, since \rho_d is the eigenstate of L relative to the eigenvalue \lambda = 0, the minimum eigenvalue of L. Now we have the fact that for any T, the minimum of the expectation of V in [0, T] is strictly smaller than 1 and we need to design F_0 such that H_R does not support any invariant set => we should be able to achieve this by DID. !Set as remark

|> Need to take the measurement efficiency into consideration when computing the control signal -> modify Feedback function to take into account eta
