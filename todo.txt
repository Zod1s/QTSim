Feedback quantum cooling
|- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04270 (it should have reasonable models to test our framework (it may be infinite-dimensional (how to simulate??? Not only, but our feedback only works for now in the finite-dimensional setting)))
|- https://journals.aps.org/pra/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevA.60.2700 (gives some models, but they are infinite-dimensional, compares filtering-based and wiseman-milburn)

|> It seems like adding a delay between subsequent activations of the feedback may help convergence, needs to study why and which are sensible values for this delay

|> Understand what reduced efficiency implies

|> Maybe Kalman filter to estimate Tr[L\rho], since we actually need the expectation of the observable and we measure it with noise, so a Kalman filter could prove useful
